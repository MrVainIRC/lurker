//
// ⚠⚠ Resolution is driven by message INGEST, never by rendering. `primePreviews` is called
// when messages enter the store — a backlog frame, a history page, a live message — and
// components only ever READ, through `useLinkPreview`.
//
// The first version had this backwards: a row asked for its preview *while rendering*, which
// kicked off a fetch, which mutated shared state, which grew the row, which forced the list to
// correct its own scroll position. Rendering had side effects, so every scroll into history
// triggered async growth and needed bespoke compensation. QA felt it exactly as described:
// "the chat loads in completely flat, then inline content loads in a burst, throwing off the
// scroll offset".
//
// Slack and Discord don't have this problem because an unfurl is part of the message record —
// it arrives WITH the message, so scrollback is laid out correctly on first paint and async
// growth only happens for a brand-new message at the bottom, where the list already follows.
// Priming at ingest is how we get that property without the server storing unfurls on every
// message (which would mean fetching for people who have the feature off).
//
// Two layers of coalescing, catching different things:
//
//   - `cache` dedupes across TIME. Scroll past a link and back, and the second pass is free.
//   - `queue` dedupes across a TICK. A history page arrives with fifty rows; they become one
//     POST rather than fifty.

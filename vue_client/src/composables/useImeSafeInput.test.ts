// The composing guard, from both sides.
//
// The fix itself is an absence — with v-model gone there is no composing flag
// left to freeze anything, so a compositionstart-driven test of the fixed
// binding passes trivially. On its own that proves nothing: a test that cannot
// fail is not a regression guard.
//
// So every case here runs against BOTH bindings. The v-model harness is the
// positive control: it is a faithful hand-assembly of what the compiler emits
// for `v-model="model"` on a native input (the vModelText directive, plus the
// `onUpdate:modelValue` assigner it reads out of the vnode), and it is expected
// to FAIL the same assertions the real binding passes. That contrast is what
// gives the passing half its meaning, and it is what fails loudly if someone
// puts v-model back on one of these fields.
//
// What none of this can prove is that a real Android keyboard behaves the way
// these synthetic events say it does. It doesn't need to: the guard lives
// entirely in Vue, not the browser. Device QA covers the other half.

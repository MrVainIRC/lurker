// looks, but buffers and the socket come up asynchronously over the WS — and
// loadAround() no-ops while the socket is closed — so the intent is held until
// both land. Shared by every deep-link entry point: the legacy `?net&buf&msg`
// query, the `/buffer/<id>?msg=` route, and the route resolver in
// useBufferRoute, which all wait on the same cold start and would be arbitrary

 * Run `act` as soon as `ready()` first holds, or `onTimeout` if it hasn't held
 * within `timeoutMs`. Fires at most once either way; returns a disposer that
 * cancels whichever is still pending.
 *
 * `ready` must read only REACTIVE state — a getter over a plain Map or a
 * module-level variable tracks nothing, so the watch would never re-fire and
 * every caller would silently fall through to its timeout. (That is not
 * hypothetical: resolving a buffer id through the module-level keyById index
 * instead of the store's reactive `byId` getter did exactly this.)

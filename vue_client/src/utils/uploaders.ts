// from each driver's own `configSchema`, so the client renders a form for a
// driver it has never heard of — adding a driver is a server-only change.
//
// The one invariant worth restating here, because it shapes every component that
// touches these types: A SECRET VALUE NEVER TRAVELS TO THE CLIENT. A secret field
// is described by the schema and reported as set-or-not via `secretsSet`; its
// value is only ever write-only. Anything that renders a `secret` field must
// therefore treat "empty" as "leave what's stored alone", not "clear it".

// calls `.m4a`, so it already got through on the `.m4a` entry. `.m4b`/`.f4a`/`.f4b`

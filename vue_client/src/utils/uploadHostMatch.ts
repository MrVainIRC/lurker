 * element the viewer renders.
 *
 * ⚠ The extension is all we have. These are arbitrary URLs from a chat message — no
 * HEAD request, no mime — so a `.mp4` served as something else will simply fail to
 * play and land on the viewer's "open in browser" card. That's the right failure: the
 * cost of guessing wrong is one dead lightbox, and the cost of NOT guessing is that
 * every image in every channel goes back to opening in a new tab.

// Deliberately WIDER than what the uploader accepts. The viewer is a renderer of
// links, not a gate on uploads: a .webm or .flac someone pastes from elsewhere plays
// perfectly well in a browser, and refusing to show it because *we* can't yet scrub its
// metadata (#553) would be enforcing our upload policy on other people's links.
// ⚠ `.3gp`/`.3g2` sit under video even though the ones we see most are audio-only
// (a Samsung voice memo — see contentClass.ts). Two reasons: the container sniffs as
// `video/3gpp` and can legitimately carry a picture, and the failure modes aren't
// symmetric — a <video> element playing audio-only content still plays it, just with a
// black frame, while an <audio> element on a real 3gp clip would silently drop the
// video. It also keeps them consistent with `.mp4`, which already renders through
// <video> when it happens to be audio-only.

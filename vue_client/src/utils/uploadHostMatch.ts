 * ⚠ The extension is all we have. These are arbitrary URLs from a chat message — no

 * play and land on the viewer's "open in browser" card. That's the right failure: the

// Deliberately WIDER than what the uploader accepts. The viewer is a renderer of
// links, not a gate on uploads: a .webm or .flac someone pastes from elsewhere plays
// perfectly well in a browser, and refusing to show it because *we* can't yet scrub its
// metadata (#553) would be enforcing our upload policy on other people's links.
// ⚠ `.3gp`/`.3g2` sit under video even though the ones we see most are audio-only
// (a Samsung voice memo — see contentClass.ts). Two reasons: the container sniffs as
// `video/3gpp` and can legitimately carry a picture, and the failure modes aren't
// symmetric — a <video> element playing audio-only content still plays it, just with a
// black frame, while an <audio> element on a real 3gp clip would silently drop the
// video. It also keeps them consistent with `.mp4`, which already renders through
// <video> when it happens to be audio-only.

  // ⚠ `.md` and `.json` are deliberately ABSENT, though the uploader mints both
  // (#788). This table judges ARBITRARY chat links by extension, and those two are
  // overwhelmingly PAGE urls rather than raw files — a GitHub blob, a docs page, an
  // API endpoint. Listing them costs twice over, on links that have nothing to do
  // with us: `RenderSegments.isViewableUrl` would swallow the click on
  // `…/blob/main/README.md` and land the user on the viewer's "could not read this
  // file" card instead of GitHub, and `previewUrls` would count the same link as
  // media, so it silently loses its preview card for anyone running link previews
  // without inline media.
  //
  // `.txt` earns its place because a `.txt` url is almost always the file itself.
  // The failure modes aren't symmetric: a wrong guess here breaks a link the user
  // did not upload, while the cost of omitting them is only that OUR OWN `.md`
  // opens in a browser tab. Re-add them keyed on the url being one of the user's
  // upload hosts — this module's name is aspirational, no such check exists yet —
  // never on the extension alone.

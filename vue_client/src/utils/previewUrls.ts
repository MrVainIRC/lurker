 * whole strip, so nothing is unreachable.

 * Which URLs in a message body are worth asking the server about.

 * The two toggles select different URLs, which is the whole reason they're two
 * settings: inline media covers links that ARE a file, link previews cover links
 * to a page. With both off this returns an empty array without touching the
 * network — that's what makes the features genuinely free when disabled.
 *
 * ⚠ The extension test here is a HINT, not a verdict. It decides which setting
 * would cover a URL and therefore whether to bother asking; the server answers
 * authoritatively from Content-Type, and the render path re-checks that answer
 * against the settings. Guessing wrong costs one wasted resolve, never a render
 * the user switched off.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ Runs through the IRC formatting parser rather than over the raw wire text, for two
 * reasons that both bite. A URL inside a SPOILER run must not be resolved at all — the
 * renderer (nickColor's `toRenderSegments`) deliberately skips URL splitting there so a link
 * can't leak hidden content, and unfurling one renders the target full-size next to the
 * click-to-reveal box, which defeats the spoiler completely. And formatting codes live INSIDE
 * the matched token otherwise: `\x03` on the end of a URL was being sent to the resolver as
 * part of the address.

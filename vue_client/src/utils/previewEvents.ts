/**
 * The message bodies in a batch of events that could actually produce a rendered attachment.
 *
 * Its own module, and not inlined in the socket layer, because it is pure policy about what the
 * server is allowed to be asked to fetch — and because nothing in the socket layer is reachable
 * from a test.
 *
 * Two filters, and both of them stop the SERVER making an outbound request on behalf of
 * something nobody will ever see:
 *
 * ⚠ **Type.** `MessageList` mounts `MessageAttachments` for `message` and `action` only, but
 * priming ran over every event in the frame — and part/quit publish their reason as `text`,
 * topic publishes the topic, and a history page ships the whole contiguous range with the noise
 * included. So joining a channel whose topic is a URL, or scrolling past
 * `Quit: HexChat https://hexchat.github.io`, made the server fetch a page no render path can
 * display. The live path already filtered this way and the backlog path did not; the two
 * disagreeing is what hid it.
 *
 * ⚠ **Ignores.** Ignoring is client-side and render-time — the server ships the event intact and
 * `MessageList` drops it while building rows — so priming, which runs BEFORE any of that,
 * happily fetched every link posted by someone the user has explicitly silenced. Ignoring
 * somebody is a veto on the fetch too, not just on the row.

  The uploads browser (#547). It used to be a single-column list of thumbnails with
  an infinite-scroll cursor: fine for "the thing I just uploaded", useless for "that
  screenshot from March", which is the case that actually needs a browser.

  Two changes make that case work. SEARCH, which is server-side — unlike almost every
  other filter in Lurker, this one cannot be a render-time filter over what the client
  holds, because the client only holds the pages it has scrolled through and the whole
  point is finding one it hasn't. And a GRID, so the eye can scan instead of squint.

  Media and text uploads have no thumbnail (no ffmpeg, so no video poster frames —
  #515), so they get a type-icon tile in the same box rather than a different layout.
  A file card that happens to show an icon reads as a peer of one that shows a photo;
  a separate list of them would not.

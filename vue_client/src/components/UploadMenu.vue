  The attach menu, behind the paperclip. One entry point for every way a file gets
  into a message: pick one off the disk, shoot one on the spot, or reuse one you
  starred earlier.

  The paperclip used to open the OS file dialog directly, and starred uploads got
  their own button next to it. That was two controls for one intent, and the star
  had to hide itself when you had no favourites to avoid offering an empty panel.
  Folding both into the paperclip means the second control disappears and the menu
  is never empty — with no favourites it is simply the upload actions, which is
  what the paperclip always did.

  A GRID of thumbnails rather than VerticalPopover's rows, because recognition here
  is visual: a column of tiny thumbs beside filenames is exactly the squint the
  uploads browser moved away from (#547). It follows MircColorPicker's shape
  instead — a panel absolutely positioned inside StatusBar's positioning context.

  ⚠ It inherits that popover's iOS focus contract: `div role=button` with
  @mousedown.prevent, acting on `click` (end of touch), never pointerdown. Losing
  focus would dismiss the soft keyboard mid-compose, and inserting into a textarea
  that just lost its caret puts the URL in the wrong place. The two upload actions
  are the deliberate exception — see the note on them.

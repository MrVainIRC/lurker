    <!-- Two or more images become one MOSAIC: a two-column grid of fixed-size cells, each image
         cropped to fill its cell.

         ⚠⚠ This replaced a horizontally-scrolling filmstrip, and the reason is the interaction
         rather than the look. A sideways scroller inside a vertically-scrolling list is a
         gesture conflict on touch — a diagonal drag has to be arbitrated, and the loser is
         whichever one the reader meant — and it hides content behind an affordance (a mask
         fade) that has to be measured, observed and kept in sync. The mosaic shows everything at
         once, needs no scroll container, no ResizeObserver and no fade.

         It keeps the property the strip was built for: the group's height is a function of the
         IMAGE COUNT alone — ceil(n / 2) rows of a fixed height — so no descriptor and no
         late-arriving byte can change it. Nothing here reads a dimension. Cropping is what buys
         that, and cropping is recoverable because any cell opens the whole set in the viewer.

         The shape rule, for any count: EVEN → all pairs; ODD → the three-up block (one
         full-height picture beside two stacked) first, then pairs. So 3 is hero-and-two, 4 is
         2x2, 5 is the three-up plus a pair, 7 the three-up plus two pairs. One rule, no holes at
         any count, and the odd block LEADS — a trailing full-width tile crops a landscape photo
         hard and makes the last picture the subject of the message. It is one CSS declaration:
         the first tile spans two rows when the count is odd, and auto-placement flows everything
         after it into pairs around the tall cell. Ported from lurker-ios, whose
         MessageAttachmentsView draws the same rule with stack views. -->

 * `<img>`. That cannot arise now: the server mints no `src` for video or audio at all, so there
 * are no bytes to hand anywhere. The filter stays because the mosaic is a grid of PICTURES, and
 * a file card is not one.

 * true, and it was never the property that mattered: what keeps the block byte-independent is
 * that its height is a function of the COUNT — ceil(n / 2) fixed rows — not that the count of
 * possible heights is small. The real bound on a message taking over the screen is
 * `MAX_MEDIA_PER_MESSAGE` (20), which is enforced before any of this. A badge was also a worse

   companion top-aligns the row's nick for the same reason.

   ⚠⚠ It does NOT follow that the gap goes to zero, and for two commits it did (lurker#773): an
   image-only message sat flush against the top edge of its row, so a hovered, alt-striped or
   highlighted row painted its background right up to the picture while every text row kept a
   sliver of it. Text never looks flush because a 1.55 line-height puts ~4px of half-leading
   above the first glyph; an image has no leading, so it is given the same 4px explicitly. It
   REPLACES the separation margin rather than adding to it — the text-then-image case already has
   its gap and would otherwise get 8px.

   ⚠ Spelled as padding because a margin here has nothing below it to collapse against and would
   collapse straight out of `.body`, taking the nick/body separator (`.body::before`) 4px down
   with it — a visible notch in a rule that is continuous on every other row.

   ⚠ It lives HERE rather than beside that `:has()` companion because a scoped rule in MessageList
   cannot reach this element: MessageBody is a multi-root fragment, so MessageList's scope id
   never propagates onto `.attachments`. The rule was written there first and did nothing at all. */

   A hero capped below its card's width leaves a band of empty panel down one side, which reads

   flush to both edges and takes the height down with it (376px of content box at 1200/630 is

   makes it the subject of the message.

   ⚠⚠ This one declaration is the whole of the "5, 7, 19 images" layout, and that is why the count
   cap could go. Auto-placement does the rest: the tall cell occupies column 1 of the first two
   rows, images 2 and 3 fill column 2 beside it, and every image after that finds the first free
   row and pairs up. Whatever the three-up block doesn't take is even by construction, so no
   count leaves a hole — which is exactly the rule lurker-ios draws with nested stack views.

   ⚠ It keys off ODD, not off `n3`. The class used to be `n${count}` and the selector `.n3`, which
   was correct only because nothing past four was ever drawn; at 5 that spelling silently
   degrades to a 2x2 grid with a hole in it. */

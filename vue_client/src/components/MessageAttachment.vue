       `stopPropagation`, so a tap anywhere in the ~99% of it that is background opened the
       lightbox AND swallowed the row click — which on touch is the only thing that opens the
       message-actions sheet. The height belongs to a wrapper that has no handlers, so those

  <!-- A page, or a video page. Discord's panel treatment: the card sits on its own slightly
       raised background so it reads as a distinct object rather than as more chat text.
       TWO shapes: a small square beside the text, or text on its own. ⚠ A landscape image under
       the text — Discord's large-embed form, and what this component briefly did — was built,
       run against real links and rejected on looking at it: the picture dominates the message
       rather than annotating it, and a 240px band per link turns a few pasted URLs into a page
       of somebody else's pictures. The square annotates, which is what a preview is for.
       ⚠ No site/author LINE. Discord doesn't have one and it was the least useful line on the
       card: the URL it names is already in the message, a word above it. The site name is still
       what the card falls back to when a page has no title — see `heading`. -->

         returns ok on a title OR an image, so `preview.title` is absent on ordinary answers —
         an og:image with no og:title, and the deliberately-degraded video record that keeps an
         embed URL after a rate-limited provider call. With the heading gated on `title` those
         rendered as a tinted panel containing a picture and nothing else, or nothing at all: no
         text, no ANCHOR, and no accessible name, since the thumbnail is `alt=""`. A preview that
         goes nowhere and names nothing still costs a card slot and a row of height.
         `heading` cannot be empty, so this element always exists and the card always links. -->
    <div class="card-text">

           full, and it cost more than it bought: on a link whose title fits it is a tooltip
           byte-identical to the text under it, and since a link takes its name from its content
           the attribute falls through to the accessible DESCRIPTION and is announced twice. It
           also does nothing where the clamp actually bites — the narrow viewport this card has a

           one they asked for by pressing play. -->
      <!-- ⚠⚠ `origin`, NOT `no-referrer`, and this is the difference between a player and an
           error message. YouTube's embedded player validates the embedding page from the
           `Referer` header, and with none it refuses every video: **"Error 153 — Video player
           configuration error"**, for the whole life of this component. Proven by A/B rather
           than reasoned about — two iframes, same embed URL, same `allow`, differing only in
           this attribute: `no-referrer` fails and `origin` plays.
           ⚠ It is a REAL trade, not a free one, and an earlier version of this comment claimed
           otherwise ("the embed request tells them anyway"). It does not: an iframe `src` load
           is a navigation, so no `Origin` header is appended, and under `no-referrer` the
           provider genuinely could not identify the embedding host. After this it learns
           `scheme://host` — which for a self-hosted instance can itself be identifying. What is
           bought is the feature existing at all, and what is NOT given up is the path: never
           which channel, which buffer, or which message.
           ⚠ `origin` rather than `strict-origin` because `origin` is the value the A/B actually
           measured. An earlier version of this comment justified the choice by claiming they
           differ on an http page, with `strict-origin` sending nothing — that is backwards.
           Referrer Policy suppresses only on a DOWNGRADE (secure → insecure), and both
           EMBED_ORIGINS are https, so an http LAN page framing them is an upgrade and the two
           values are byte-identical in every configuration reachable today. `strict-origin` is
           the safer default the moment a non-https embed origin is ever added; it is not adopted
           here on the strength of a spec reading, because a spec reading is what produced the
           sentence this one replaces.
           The privacy property doing the real work is the facade above: nothing at all is
           requested from the video host until the reader asks for it. -->

 * Times and the BBC declare an image and no size at all. And ⚠⚠ `twitter:card` cannot stand in

 * the author's stated intent disagrees with the author's own picture in exactly the direction

 * A version of this component tracked a `failed` flag to paint a panel fill instead of the UA's

 *
 *   - Setting a non-empty `alt` on failure re-triggers frame construction in Gecko and DROPS the
 *     attribute-derived aspect ratio, collapsing a measured 240px box to an 18px text line —
 *     222px of uncompensated shrink that plain `alt=""` does not suffer. The old shape held 240px
 *     in Blink, WebKit and Gecko alike.
 *   - The reset that was supposed to clear the flag could never fire: `mintProxyToken` is an HMAC
 *     over the URL, so a re-delivered answer carries a byte-identical `src` and the watch on it
 *     never runs. And an `ok` preview is never re-asked at all, so the flag was permanent — a
 *     two-second network blip greyed out every inline image for the life of the row.
 *   - Dropping `role`/`tabindex` on failure removed them from an element that may currently HOLD
 *     focus, dumping a keyboard user back to `<body>` mid-strip.
 *
 * The byte-independence rule this file serves is already satisfied without any of it: the
 * width/height attributes survive a failed load, and `.dim-reserve` pins the one shape that has none.
 * A broken-image glyph in a correctly-sized box is a smaller problem than every one of the above.

// Three levels, matching the split in the components:
//   - MessageAttachment renders ONE resolved preview.
//   - MessageAttachments decides the ARRANGEMENT (mosaic vs stacked) from a list it is handed.
//   - MessageBody owns the resolved set — the reveal latch, the settings gating and which URLs
//     the body text drops — because the text and the attachments have to agree on all three.
//
// ⚠ Most of the suites below mount MessageBody even where the assertion is about arrangement.
// That is deliberate: MessageAttachments is now presentational, so mounting it directly would
// test a hand-built list rather than the one the app produces.
//
// The first suite exists because QA saw no YouTube card while the server was verified to be
// answering correctly — nothing was testing the span between those two facts.

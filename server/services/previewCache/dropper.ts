// The hosted backend (CP #63). Bytes go to the operator-run dropper service —
// POST /api/previews with the cell-computed key — which writes them under the
// fleet bucket's `previews/` prefix, and browsers read them DIRECTLY from the
// CDN in front of that bucket. The cell holds an upload key and nothing else:
// no bucket credentials, no delete capability, by design. The staging, ceiling
// and bounded-read machinery is shared with the s3 backend (./remoteWrite.ts,
// `readRemote`); this module's own parts are the multipart POST and the CDN GET.
//
// ⚠ The key is the SAME `byteCacheKey` digest every cell computes for a URL, so
// the cache is shared fleet-wide: cell B re-storing what cell A already stored
// is an idempotent overwrite of the same object, not a conflict.
//
// ⚠⚠ Everything the s3 module's header says about WHAT A PUBLIC OBJECT CAN AND
// CANNOT CARRY applies verbatim here — same bucket, same CDN, same three
// replayable headers. The dropper sets Content-Type, Content-Disposition and
// Cache-Control on the object at store time; nosniff and the CSP sandbox are
// not expressible, and the bound on that is the dropper's own image-only,
// signature-verified allowlist.

 * ⚠ `accept-encoding: identity`, unlike the s3 read, because this GET goes
 * through a CDN rather than a bucket API. An edge that compressed the response
 * would make `readRemote`'s Content-Length bound test the WIRE size while the
 * decompressed body inflates past it in the heap — and the inflated length
 * would no longer equal the index row's recorded size, so every proxy read of a

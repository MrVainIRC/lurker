// What IS this file? Decided from its magic bytes, on the server, every time.
//
// THE RULE: the bytes have absolute authority over the CLASS. The client's claim is
// consulted only where it cannot cause a bypass, because a real image would have been
// caught by the sniff regardless of what it was called:
//   • telling text apart from SVG among signature-less UTF-8 content
//   • naming which text dialect that content is — .txt, .md or .json (#788)
// Both answer "what do we call these bytes", never "do we take them".
//
// Why it has to be this way: the route used to take the client's word for it
// (`req.file.mimetype === 'text/plain'`). That was survivable while the only two
// outcomes were "image pipeline" or "text passthrough" — nobody gains by lying. The
// moment a class means "your bytes go out untouched", a claimed MIME becomes a
// route AROUND imagePipeline.optimize(), and that is where the EXIF scrub lives
// (#516). Announce your geotagged JPEG as video/mp4 and the GPS rides along.
//
// The accepted set is a GUARANTEE, not a preference: we accept exactly the formats
// we can strip metadata from (design decision 21). Adding a format here without a
// scrubber for it silently breaks the promise the uploader makes about metadata.
// Arbitrary binary is deliberately NOT a thing — DCC is the file-transfer path
// (decision 20).

 * The media we accept — i.e. the media we can clean (decision 21).

 * All ISO-BMFF except mp3, which is why one box-walking scrubber covers seven of the
 * eight. Deliberately ABSENT: WebM/Ogg/FLAC/WAV. Not because they're dangerous — a
 * WebM comes from a browser recorder and carries a muxer name and a date, not a
 * location — but because we have no scrubber for them yet, and "everything we
 * accept, we clean" is a better rule than "everything we accept, we clean, except
 * these four". They're each a small follow-up (EBML has a `Void` element that plays
 * the same role `free` does in MP4, so the trick transfers).
 *
 * MIMEs verified against file-type 22 (`source/index.js`, the `ftyp` switch) with
 * real and synthesized containers. file-type labels an ISO-BMFF file by its major
 * `ftyp` brand, so ONE box structure surfaces under several MIMEs we handle
 * identically:
 *   • `M4A `                → audio/x-m4a
 *   • `M4B `/`F4A `/`F4B `  → audio/mp4     (iTunes audiobooks, Flash audio)
 *   • `3g2*`                → video/3gpp2
 *   • any other `3g*`       → video/3gpp
 *   • everything else       → video/mp4     (the switch's default branch)
 *
 * ⚠ That last line is the trap: `audio/mp4` is NOT "the audio-only MIME". An
 * audio-only file with an `mp42`/`isom` brand — which is most of them — falls to the
 * default and sniffs as `video/mp4`. Only the four brands above ever produce it.
 *
 * The 3GPP entries are not theoretical. Samsung's stock voice recorder
 * (`com.sec.android.app.voicenote`) writes a `3gp4`-branded container holding AAC and
 * names the file `.m4a`, so sharing a voice memo off a Galaxy used to 415 while the
 * identical box structure under an `mp42` brand went through. The file we refused
 * carried the recorder's app fingerprint, the Android version, and a UTC offset that
 * pins the recorder's timezone — refusing it protected nobody, it just sent that
 * metadata out via some other host. walkBoxes strips all of it, size-preserving.
 *
 * m4a-ish brands serve as `.m4a`; 3GPP keeps its honest container extension.

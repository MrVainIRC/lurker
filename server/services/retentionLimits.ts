// THE per-buffer history cap, in one place (lurker-dev/RETENTION_PLAN.md).
//
// Two values stack, and the effective cap is the smaller of the ones actually
// set:
//
//   1. the operator ceiling  LURKER_MAX_RETENTION_LINES. An env var rather
//                            than a tenant setting for the same reason
//                            LURKER_MAX_UPLOAD_MB is: it describes the
//                            deployment, and a tenant must not be able to
//                            raise it. There is deliberately no separate
//                            operator *default* — an untouched user setting
//                            resolves to unlimited and then clamps to the
//                            ceiling, so the ceiling IS the default.
//   2. the user's own        `data.retention.lines` (0 = unlimited).
//
// 0 (or unset) means "keep everything" at every layer. Every path that
// enforces or advertises a retention cap goes through effectiveRetentionLines
// so the sweeper and whatever a client is told can never disagree.

 *
 * ⚠ Must be >= MAX_URLS_PER_REQUEST, and overflow must QUEUE rather than fail. An earlier
 * version had a cap of 6 and answered overflow with `unavailable` immediately, which quietly
 * broke the common case rather than a rare one: `resolvePreview` runs synchronously up to its
 * first await, so `Promise.all` over a 20-URL batch started all 20 before any finished — calls
 * 7 through 20 saw a full pool and were refused without ever dialling. On a link-heavy history
 * page 6 previews rendered and 14 links stayed bare, and because the client stores whatever
 * verdict it's given, they stayed bare for the rest of the session.
 *
 * ⚠ This is also what bounds how many DNS lookups RESOLVING has outstanding, and that matters
 * more than it reads. (The byte proxy is the other half and needs its own — see `mediaPool` in
 * routes/linkPreview.ts, which is the higher-volume one: a link resolves once, but every image
 * on screen is a byte request.) `getaddrinfo` runs on libuv's thread pool, which caps it at
 * `(nthreads + 1) / 2` slots, and it CANNOT be cancelled — `req.destroy()` returns at once
 * while the lookup keeps its slot for the full OS timeout. Measured while building this: eight
 * concurrent blackholed lookups delayed an unrelated `dns.lookup` by ~20 s, and on this server
 * the other DNS consumer is IRC connection setup.
 *
 * The honest limits of the bound, since a comment claiming a guarantee is a claim to test:
 * it bounds fetches in flight, not lookups outstanding. A hop that gives up at
 * HOP_DEADLINE_MS frees its slot to a new fetch while its own lookup is still pending, so a
 * sustained stream of unresolvable hostnames can leave more than MAX_CONCURRENT lookups queued.
 * Fixing that needs a cancellable resolver (`dns.Resolver` over UDP rather than getaddrinfo),
 * which is a change to the fetcher, not to its caller. Bounding it here is what's available,
 * and it is strictly better than not bounding it.
 *
 * ⚠ Do NOT try to bound this with `maxSockets` on linkFetch's agents instead. node marks a
 * request `shouldKeepAlive = false` only when `!agent.keepAlive && !isFinite(agent.maxSockets)`,
 * and the agent hands a released socket to a queued same-host request before it ever consults
 * `keepAlive` — so capping the agents silently restores socket reuse, and a reused socket skips
 * DNS, which skips the pinned lookup that is the SSRF guard.

// THE upload size cap, in one place (#627).
//
// Three ceilings stack, and a client that wants to size media to fit needs the
// smallest of them — not any single one:
//
//   1. MAX_CAP_BYTES     the registry's own hard ceiling; nothing may exceed it.
//   2. transportCapBytes the request-body limit of whatever sits IN FRONT of this
//                        instance. app.lurker.chat is behind Cloudflare, whose
//                        limit is 100 MB on Free/Pro (200 MB on Business); a
//                        larger body dies at the edge with a connection reset the
//                        client sees as an unparseable response, before Express is
//                        ever reached. The server cannot detect this, so the
//                        operator declares it via LURKER_MAX_UPLOAD_MB.
//   3. the per-user cap  the operator-baked uploader policy (hosted locked row),
//                        else the user's own `uploads.image.max_upload_mb`.
//
// Every upload path that enforces or advertises a cap goes through here, so
// multer's limit, the handler's 413, and the number we hand clients can never
// disagree. (`POST /api/imports` has its own, much larger, body limit and is
// deliberately not covered — it isn't something a client sizes media against.)
//
// Bytes, not MB, is the canonical unit: it's what multer takes, what a client
// compares a file size against, and the only unit in which the transport
// ceiling's headroom below can be expressed honestly.

 *
 * Deliberately an env var rather than a tenant setting, for the same reason the

 * and a tenant must not be able to raise it.
 *
 * The declared MB is read as DECIMAL (10⁶), unlike the per-user setting's MiB.
 * Proxies disagree — Cloudflare documents decimal MB, nginx's `client_max_body_size
 * 100m` is 100 MiB — and the decimal reading is the smaller of the two, so it is
 * the safe one when the proxy's own unit is unknown. Erring 4.8% low costs a
 * self-hoster nothing; erring high is the edge reset again.

// The per-connection backlog: every inbound IRC line the app has not yet acked,
// numbered so a re-attaching app can resume exactly where the last one stopped.
//
// Bounded in BYTES, not lines, because one busy channel and one quiet one differ
// by orders of magnitude in line length and what we actually protect is the
// engine's memory. When the cap is hit the OLDEST lines go — the app will learn
// the shape of the hole from the recorded gap and can say so (or backfill from
// CHATHISTORY where the network offers it). Newer lines are kept because they
// are the ones that describe the state the app is about to attach to.
//
// Deliberately in memory only. The app's SQLite is the durable store; this
// buffer exists to bridge a redeploy, not to be a second message log. A
// spill-to-disk implementation would slot in behind the same interface if
// cross-host engines ever need to cover hour-long detaches.

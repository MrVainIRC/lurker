// Bookkeeping for the preview BYTE cache — what is stored, how big it is, and
// when it was last read. The bytes themselves live on disk or in a bucket; this
// table holds only the index (see the schema note in db/index.ts for why blobs
// here would be a mistake on a Litestream-replicated database).
//
// ⚠ Existence is answered from HERE, never by asking the backend. The whole
// point of the cache is to remove a round trip, and a HEAD to S3 on every byte
// request would just trade an origin fetch for a bucket fetch. The cost of that
// choice is that the table can disagree with reality — a bucket emptied by a
// lifecycle rule, a data directory wiped between deploys — so every read path
// treats "row says yes, backend says no" as an ordinary miss and repairs the
// row rather than failing the request. See `forget`.

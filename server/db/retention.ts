// ─── Closed-buffer garbage collection ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Deleting a whole buffer is the sanctioned policy-driven EXCEPTION to
// deleteBuffer's "only when no history" contract (db/buffers.ts, the
// evict/forget guards): the operator or user chose it, per
// lurker-dev/RETENTION_PLAN.md §4.5. The rules that keep it honest — and
// every one of them is enforced IN the statements, not sampled once at
// listing time, because the drain yields to the event loop between batches
// and the world moves while it does:
//   1. Eligibility re-derives from closed_at each pass (julianday, so the
//      SQLite datetime the close path writes and the ISO imports stamp both
//      compare correctly); autojoin rows are never dead buffers; server/system
//      pseudo-buffers store their lines elsewhere.
//   2. A buffer holding ANY bookmarked message is skipped, and the drain
//      itself carries the owner-scoped bookmark exemption — a bookmark placed
//      mid-drain (search reaches closed buffers by design) stops the drain
//      short and the row delete then refuses because rows remain.
//   3. Every drain batch and the final row delete re-check state='closed' AND
//      the age: a buffer reopened mid-drain stops losing rows on the very next
//      batch, and a reopen-then-reclose (closed_at re-stamped to now) is no
//      longer old enough. Messages drain in budgeted batches BEFORE the row
//      goes — one cascading DELETE over a big buffer would fire the FTS
//      trigger per row synchronously on the shared connection.

// The bookmark exclusion is a bound, non-correlated subquery (materialized
// once per statement) driving from the user's bookmarks — few — rather than a
// correlated probe walking each candidate buffer's rows.

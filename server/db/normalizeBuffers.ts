// The v17 normalization bodies: mint the buffers rows that message history
// implies, then stamp messages.buffer_id from them. Exported (and handed the
// db) rather than inlined in index.ts for three reasons: index.ts calls them
// at module load mid-evaluation (importing it back would be a cycle — same
// pattern as foldBufferCase/seedUploaderConfig), the import path reuses them
// to normalize v1 archives, and the kill/resume behavior is unit-testable.
//
// Everything here is idempotent and re-runnable: mints are insert-if-absent,
// the backfill only touches `buffer_id IS NULL` rows, and progress persists in
// app_meta inside each chunk's transaction. A watchdog kill mid-run loses at
// most one chunk and the next boot resumes where it left off — the restart
// loop documented on the idx_messages_unread build (a one-shot, non-resumable
// stall) structurally cannot happen here.
//
// Folding: lookups everywhere else fold with JS toLowerCase (buffers.ts
// foldTarget — Unicode-aware), but a set-based UPDATE can only call SQL
// functions, and SQLite's lower() is ASCII-only. `#Ärger` folds differently
// under the two, which is exactly the class of bug #707 catalogues. So the
// SQL side calls a registered custom function that IS foldTarget, and the two
// rules cannot diverge.

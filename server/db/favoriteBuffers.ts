// Buffer favorites (the Friends/Contacts replacement). Keyed (user_id,
// buffer_id) — born id-keyed at v19, no name-keyed generation ever existed.
// Unlike pinned_buffers, position density is per USER: one global order
// spanning networks. Clients render the list as kind-filtered sections
// (queries → "Friends", channels → "Favorites"); a subset reorder preserves
// the relative order of unmentioned rows, which is what keeps the two
// filtered sections independently draggable against the one list (same
// semantics as reorderPins, issue #405).
//
// The listing shape carries (networkId, target, bufferId) per entry — the
// favorites-changed frame ships it verbatim, and target strings come joined
// from `buffers` in canonical casing.

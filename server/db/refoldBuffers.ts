// Re-fold one network's buffer registry under a newly-declared CASEMAPPING
// (#707). Runs when the capture path (ircConnection's raw-005 token scan)
// sees a declared mapping that differs from what's stored — first contact
// with a declaring server included, since every existing row was folded with
// the legacy Unicode-lowercase rule. This pass is also the mapping's ONE
// writer: the store rides inside the refold transaction (see below).
//
// Two things can change:
//
//  - A row's stored fold no longer matches the declared rule (`#Ärger` was
//    folded to `#ärger`; ascii-family rules leave `Ä` alone). Rewritten in
//    place — nothing user-visible, target_folded never leaves the server.
//  - Two rows now fold TOGETHER (`#foo[bar]` and `#foo{bar}` under rfc1459).
//    Merged via the rename machinery's absorb, one buffer-renamed frame per
//    absorbed row (the caller announces) — clients handle it exactly like a
//    DM nick-collision merge.
//
// Survivor choice mirrors what the fold repair has always preferred (see
// foldBufferCase: "the buffer you actually used"): an open row beats a closed
// one, then the row with the most recent message, then the older row id — a
// deterministic tiebreak, not a policy.

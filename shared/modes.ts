// Mode-change classification, and the "is this row churn?" question the event
// filters ask of it.
//
// A single IRC MODE message carries a list of changes, and the three classes
// behave nothing alike:
//
//   +o alice          a MEMBER's status changed — the op/voice churn that
//                     motivates every filter in this file
//   +b *!*@host       a LIST mode: a mask was added to the ban/exception/quiet
//                     list. Consequential, and never churn.
//   +m / +k / +l 50   a CHANNEL flag or parameter mode. Also not churn.
//
// Telling them apart requires the server's ISUPPORT PREFIX and CHANMODES
// tokens, which the browser has never seen and has no business parsing — so
// the SERVER classifies each change at publish time and stamps `kind` onto it
// (see classifyModeChange). The stamp rides `extra.modes` into storage, so a
// backlog row answers the question the same way a live one does.
//
// ⚠ Do NOT reintroduce a hardcoded q/a/o/h/v set on either side. It was tried
// and it disagreed with solanum, where `+q` is a quiet LIST mode rather than an
// owner prefix — see the comment on IrcConnection.prefixModes().

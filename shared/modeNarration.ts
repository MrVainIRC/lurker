// Turning a MODE row into a sentence.
//
// The line used to render as `mode by ChanServ: +o alice` — the raw wire form
// with a label bolted on, which asks the reader to know IRC mode syntax to find
// out that somebody got opped. gamja narrates these instead
// (`components/buffer.js`), and it reads enormously better; this is that idea,
// built on the `kind` stamp from shared/modes.ts so it can tell `+o alice` (a
// nick) from `+b alice` (a mask that happens to look like one).
//
// Output is a SEGMENT LIST rather than a string so the caller can render the
// affected nick as a real nick — clickable, colored, with the nick menu on it,
// which the raw form never offered. It also keeps this file free of any view
// framework, so the phone can port it as-is.
//
// Only a SINGLE-change message is narrated. A message carrying several changes
// falls back to a compact mode string, matching gamja (which gates its
// narration on `modeStr.length === 2`): "gave op to alice and banned *!*@host
// and set the user limit to 50" is worse than `+o-b+l alice *!*@host 50`, and
// the multi-change case is overwhelmingly services bursts rather than something
// a human typed.
